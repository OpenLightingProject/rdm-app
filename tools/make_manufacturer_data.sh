# Convert extended characters to closest normal equivalent
# TODO(Peter): Check if rdm-app and OLA can handle extended characters (or fix
# if not) and start allowing them through
# Remove duplicate entry for manufacturer 0x0000
# Remove duplicate entry for manufacturer 0x4C5A; keep the original owner of the ID
# Remove any H's after the manufacturer IDs and generally sanitise the rows
# TODO(Peter): Comment out any invalid rows
